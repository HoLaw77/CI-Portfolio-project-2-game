<h1>Bugs</h1>
<h2>Solve bug</h2>
<ul>

<li>I discover that some of my photo can not be positioned in the center of the page using align items.</li>
<li>After checking in the W3school, I used the display:flex method to avoid adding padding to the image and fix it in the center of page even the media screen size changes.</li>
<li>I also face difficulty in setting up a restart button. After revising the usage of window.location.reload(), I used this in index.html to avoid writing this function in script.js.</li>

</ul>
